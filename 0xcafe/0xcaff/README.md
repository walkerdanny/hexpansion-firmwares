# Caffeine Jitters Driver
## A.K.A. the cool drinking hat man hexpansion

This is the bare bones driver app for the Caffeine Jitters hexpansion.

It launches a simple background service, which responds to events from the eventbus, which are emitted by other apps.

Currently it responds to:
- `EmotePositiveEvent` with a long upwards ramp
- `EmoteNegativeEvent` with a long downwards ramp
- `ShowNotificationEvent` with a double click
- `dict` types emitted from the eventbus (see below)

This allows any app to add haptic feedback with just a couple of lines of extra code, without needing to scan for the hexpansion.

If you want something other than just the default positive and negative, you emit a custom `dict` event using the following:

```python
from system.eventbus import eventbus

eventbus.emit({"type":"haptic", "haptic_type": "YOUR_EFFECT_HERE", "duration" = 500})
```

Where `YOUR_EFFECT_HERE` is one of the following keywords, passed as a string:
- `click`
- `double_click`
- `double_click_long`
- `triple_click`
- `buzz`
- `tick`
- `ramp_up_medium`
- `ramp_up_short`
- `ramp_up_long`
- `ramp_down_short`
- `ramp_down_medium`
- `ramp_down_long`
- `continuous` (See below)
- `hum` (See below)

When using the `continuous` or `hum` haptic types, you need to specify the `duration` as well, in milliseconds. Leaving this parameter out will result in no response. For the other effects it can be omitted.


## The driver uses a very lightly modified port of Adafruit's DRV2605 library, I take absolutely no credit for any of the good work that's gone into it, only the bad work. Used and reproduced under the MIT License.

See also the chip datasheet at https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf if you want to hack in some more events to your own version of the firmware, there's hundreds to play with and I've only included a small subset.
